# My Advent of Code 2024 solutions

The goal of this challenge is to practice problem solving, typescript/javascript language skills and have fun comparing my solutions with friends :)

## Running

To be able to run the solution you need `npm` installed (version 5.2.0 or above).

Typescript interpreter `tsx` can be executed with `npx` â€” a tool bundled with npm to run npm packages without installing them.

The project has zero dependencies to install. In your command-line, simply pass in a typescript file you'd like to run.

```
npx tsx ./day-01/puzzle1.ts
```
